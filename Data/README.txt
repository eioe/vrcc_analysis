#########

This is only a placeholder folder. 
It is ignored by Git and will not be updated with commits/pulls.
You can use this folder to (locally!) add (or link) the data and make it easily accesible by flexible scripts which look for the data in this part of the folder structure. However, these data will stay on your local machine and not be commited to the repo (not even locally).
For sharing data, other ways are more efficient, stable, and secure.
